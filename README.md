This study expands the Collatz-Octave Model (COM) by incorporating the HQS (23.5\%) and LZ (1.23498) constants from Unified Oscillatory Dynamic Field Theory (UODFT). We demonstrate that these quantum-derived scaling factors precisely govern planetary distances, masses, and orbital velocities when integrated with COM's octave structuring. Our analysis reveals that the Solar System's architecture emerges from a harmonic resonance pattern matching atomic energy scaling, with relativistic corrections accounting for residual deviations. The modified COM framework shows remarkable alignment with both Solar System and exoplanetary data, suggesting a universal oscillatory basis for celestial mechanics.
